Buckets
=======

The current bucket offerings which are built in.

Note, this package is not dependant on Nextcord and
if you do not have it there won't be any issues if you don't use it.

.. currentmodule:: cooldowns.buckets

.. autoclass:: CooldownBucket
    :members:
    :noindex:

This requires a full import, and Nextcord.

.. currentmodule:: cooldowns.buckets.slash

.. autoclass:: SlashBucket
    :members:
    :noindex:
